# AMQP to Rest

An AMQP Consumer that gets the structured content of messages in a queue, gets the authorization headers from configured endpoints and send the messages to defined REST API endpoints

It works very well with https://github.com/rodrigoirala/http_auth_header_generator to get the authentication header for HTTP requests.
